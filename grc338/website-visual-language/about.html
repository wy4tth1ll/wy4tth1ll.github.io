            <article>
               <p>Perched high above the vibrant energy of Los Angeles, Wyatt’s Cucina Italiano blends modern sophistication with the rich culinary heritage of Italy. Our rooftop setting captures sweeping skyline views, inviting guests to dine among the city lights while experiencing the warmth and passion that define Italian hospitality. From intimate dinners to celebratory nights out, Wyatt’s is where unforgettable moments rise above the ordinary.</p>
               <p>Our cuisine is rooted in authentic Italian tradition, elevated with fresh California influence. We source premium ingredients from local farms and artisan producers, crafting dishes that balance rustic comfort with contemporary creativity. Hand-rolled pastas, wood-fired specialties, and vibrant seasonal plates showcase the heart of Italy through a bold, innovative lens—made to be shared, savored, and remembered.</p>
               <p>Wyatt’s Cucina Italiano is as much a destination as it is a dining experience. Our handcrafted cocktail program features Italian spirits, wines from iconic regions, and signature twists inspired by the West Coast. Whether you’re sipping a Negroni al tramonto during sunset or raising a glass of prosecco under the stars, every visit is designed to feel like a celebration.</p>
               <p>At Wyatt’s, our mission is simple: exceptional food, elevated ambiance, and hospitality that feels personal. We believe the best meals are defined not only by flavor but by the people and the setting that surround them. Join us above the city—where Italian tradition meets the skyline of Los Angeles, and every night becomes la dolce vita. </p>
